    "## Bisection Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another algorithm that is well known among computer scientists: a *bisection search*.  Instead of making a single guess, imagine a window, or an interval of numbers that we know contains the square root of $x$. At the beginning, we can use the window from 0 to $x$.  Clearly, the square root of $x$ has to be in there somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](bisect1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's look at the midpoint of our window, which will be $x/2$ at the moment. We can check if this point is too low or too high by squaring it and comparing it to $x$. If the midpoint of our window is too low, we can throw away the bottom half of the window and focus on the top half. Otherwise, we throw out the top half of the window and focus on the bottom half. \n",
    "\n",
    "![title](bisect2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that our first midpoint was too high.  Now we have a new window, which ranges from `0` to `x/2`, and we can repeat the same process.  Eventually our window will be small enough that we know the midpoint is within epsilon of the right answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python script below implements a bisection search. Notice that we use variables low and high to keep track of the bottom and the top of our window. When the size of the window shrinks below 2 * epsilon, we know that any point inside the window is within epsilon of the midpoint. This means that the midpoint is a valid guess for the square root of $x$, up to the precision we want."

    "The bisection search is appropriate for a wide range of computing problems.  It leverages the fact that our solution space is ordered.  We know that if our guess squared is bigger than x, then anything bigger than our guess is also too big.  By leveraging this structure, the bisection search can complete much faster than a brute force algorithm.  When you see a solution space that's ordered in this way, consider where a bisection search could be adapted to solve your problem."
